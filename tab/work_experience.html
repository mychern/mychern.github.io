          Wrote end-to-end Digital Video Recorder (DVR) testing system for
          Over-the-Top streaming services. The test system is fully automated,
          and, regularly, it samples recordable entities and goes through the
          processing of recording them on various devices to test their
          playabilities on these device types. This test system makes sure that
          DVR processing bugs are caught in hours, reduced from days.
