      <p>
        I'm an undergraduate student in the
        <a href="https://theory.cs.columbia.edu/">Theoretical CS at Columbia</a
        >, anticipated to graduate in May 2026, with some exposures to math and
        physics (<a href="tab/at_school.html">courseworks</a>). <br /><br />
        I'm broadly interested in anything theory-related. As of now, I'm
        actively thinking about:
        <li>
          <!-- improving the privacy decay of a fairly general class of adaptive -->
          <!-- differentially private algorithms. -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- applying variants of interactive proof systems to get hardness and -->
          <!-- separation results (under assumptions). -->
        </li>
        Outside of theory, I worked at Google as a software engineering intern
        as well as a few start-ups and VCs with an engineering focus (<a

        >). <br /><br />

      <h2>Personal Constitution</h2>
      Fundamentally, I'm driven by privacy, the pursuit of "<a
        href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html"
        >the right to be let alone</a
      >". My interests in cryptography, privacy, and theoretical foundations of
      related fields are instantiations of this fundamental drive.

      <h2 id="interests">Trivia</h2>
      I spent two summers in high school painting and drawing. I still do casual
      drawings from time to time. I also play basketball and tennis for fun,
      though these have been hard since I came to New York... I enjoy walking
      around, getting coffee and boba.

        My great grandfather was a Chinese history scholar whom I spent a lot of
        time with before high school. As a scholar, he was a target of the "<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laogai"
          >Laogai</a
        >" for decades. I always remember him as the knowledgeable and positive
        man who couldn't stop talking about history in front his wall of books
        printed from his scholarly days in 1930s/40s, survived by his hiding and
        protection. This memory of him lives on in my habit of reading wikipedia
        pages about Chinese history and digital records of ancient texts (<a
          href="https://ctext.org/zhs"
          >through this great effort!</a
        >) all the time. For trivia, I can match most Gregorian years to their
        corresponding Chinese era names.

        For various reasons, I've moved around a lot through my life (mostly by
        myself other than when I go home). Originally from Ningbo, China, I've
        lived in, studied and/or worked at the following places for extended
        time periods:
        <li>
          <b>In China:</b> Ningbo (where I grew up), Shanghai (where my mom's
          family is), Beijing (for most of my gap year in 2020-21).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>In the U.S.:</b> Machester / Auburn, New Hampshire (for one year of
          middle school); Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (for high school); New York
          City, New York (for college); San Francisco Bay Area (for three
          summers at Google).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Others:</b> I spent a year between middle school and high school,
          studying abroad in Aukland, New Zealand, and Paris, France.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        I like languages. I'm fluent in English and Mandarin, took Latin to the
        AP level, and am currently trying to learn French and Russian.
