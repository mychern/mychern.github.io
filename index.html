      <p>
        I'm an undergraduate student at
        <a href="https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/">Columbia Engineering</a>
        anticipated to graduate in May 2026, majoring in theoretical computer
        science (TCS), with some exposures to math and physics (please see
        <a href="#courseworks">courseworks</a>). <br /><br />
        I'm open-minded and broadly interested in anything theory-related.
        Currently, I'm thinking about lower bounds of multi-party quantum
        communications, RL when agents hide certain information, and Boolean
        functions. My main learning objectives right now are
        <a href="teaching/24sp-tcs-quantum.html">quantum complexity</a>,
        information theory, and coding theory. Here are some of my other
        non-academic <a href="#interests">interests</a>. <br /><br />
        My email is yc3879-at-columbia-dot-edu. I also go by Yang (阳, yáng)
        Chen (陈, chén).

        <li>
          Wrote end-to-end Digital Video Recorder (DVR) testing system for
          Over-the-Top streaming services. The test system is fully automated,
          and, regularly, it samples recordable entities and goes through the
          processing of recording them on various devices to test their
          playabilities on these device types. This test system makes sure that
          DVR processing bugs are caught in hours, reduced from days.

      <p>
        Gap year from 2020-2021 before college and worked on tech-focused,
        early-stage investments.<br /><br />

        In summer 2021, I worked with Nantucket and learned about portfolio
        management, risk management, asset allocation, etc. Wrote a JavaScript
        program for Nantucket to visualize liquidity schedule in real time.<br /><br />

        Before summer 2021, I worked with ZhenFund, K2VC, and Ivy Capital and
        did research in markets and products related to SaaS model, social
        media, cross-border e-commerce, fast fashion commerce, etc. Wrote a
        Python program for project scouting on public Internet.

      <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
      I spent two summers in high school painting and drawing. I still do casual
      drawings from time to time :). I also really like playing basketball and
      tennis from time to time, though these have been hard since I came to New
      York... I enjoy walking and getting boba.
      <p>
        I spent a lot of time reading wikipedia pages about Chinese history. For
        trivia, I can match most Gregorian years to their corresponding Chinese
        era names.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like languages. I'm fluent in English and Mandarin, took Latin to the
        AP level, and am currently trying to learn French and Russian.
