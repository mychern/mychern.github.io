      <h1>Mark Chen</h1>
      <p>
        I'm an undergraduate student anticipated to graduate in May 2025 at
        <a href="https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/">Columbia Engineering</a
        >, majoring in theoretical computer science (TCS). <br /><br />
        As a young aspirant in TCS, I'm open-minded and broadly interested in
        different branches of TCS, and I'm also curious to understand the many
        underlying technical details of fields related to TCS, which is why I've
        been exploring many fields in pure mathematics and theoretical physics
        recently. <br /><br />
        I'm currently spending more time on how property testing and
        unconditional lower bounds play together for a strong encryption no
        matter whether conditions like "P = NP" are true or not. I also enjoy
        building tangible programs, walking, painting, and getting boba with my
        free time!
        <br /><br />
        My email is yc3879-at-columbia-dot-edu. I also go by Yang (阳) Chen
        (陈).

      I spent two summers in high school painting and drawing. I still do casual
      drawings from time to time :). I also really like playing basketball and
      play tennis from time to time, though these have been hard since I came to
      New York...
