# Hello World

This is Mark Chen, an undergraduate student at Columbia Engineering majoring in Computer Science. My main focus are theoretical computer science, and, as a young aspirant, I have a broad interest in the field in general. I'm also interested in the technical details of fields related to some major TCS branches, which is why I also explored many pure math and theoretical physics classes.
